# Claude Resources Share

One-direction publish from `~/.claude/` (private) to `$HOME/repos/p/claude-resources` (public).

## Paths

- **Source**: `~/.claude/`
- **Target**: `$HOME/repos/p/claude-resources`

## Directories to copy

| Source | Target |
|--------|--------|
| `~/.claude/commands/` | `commands/` |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | `skills/` |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | `agents/` |
| `~/.claude/hooks/` | `hooks/` |
| `~/.claude/scripts/` | `scripts/` |
| `~/.claude/doc/` | `doc/` |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` |

## Excludes (apply to all rsync operations)

- `node_modules/`
- `.docusaurus/`
- `dist/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `.DS_Store`
- `*.pyc`
- `.cache/`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `package-lock.json`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan for private info

Invoke the `/purge-private-info` command, targeting the source directories listed above. Scan file contents for:

- API keys, tokens, passwords, webhook keys
- Client/corporate names that appear to be real clients
- Personal SNS accounts (other than the repo owner's)
- Hardcoded absolute paths containing usernames (e.g., `$HOME/`)

Present all findings to the user. **Do NOT proceed until the user explicitly confirms** there are no problems or that findings are acceptable.

### Step 2: Prepare target directory

```bash
# Create target if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $HOME/repos/p/claude-resources
```

If the target has a `.git/` directory, preserve it. If not, the user should initialize it separately.

### Step 3: Clean and copy

Remove old content in the target (preserving `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`):

```bash
# Remove previous copies (but preserve git and repo meta files)
cd $HOME/repos/p/claude-resources
for dir in commands skills agents hooks scripts doc; do
  rm -rf "./$dir"
done
rm -f ./CLAUDE.md
```

Then copy each directory using rsync:

```bash
EXCLUDES="--exclude=node_modules --exclude=.docusaurus --exclude=dist --exclude=__pycache__ --exclude=.DS_Store --exclude='*.pyc' --exclude=.cache --exclude=pnpm-lock.yaml --exclude=package-lock.json"

SRC="$HOME/.claude"
DST="$HOME/repos/p/claude-resources"

rsync -av $EXCLUDES "$SRC/commands/" "$DST/commands/"
rsync -av $EXCLUDES "$SRC/skills/" "$DST/skills/"
rsync -av $EXCLUDES "$SRC/agents/" "$DST/agents/"
rsync -av $EXCLUDES "$SRC/hooks/" "$DST/hooks/"
rsync -av $EXCLUDES "$SRC/scripts/" "$DST/scripts/"
rsync -av $EXCLUDES "$SRC/doc/" "$DST/doc/"
cp "$SRC/CLAUDE.md" "$DST/CLAUDE.md"
```

### Step 4: Summary

After copying, report file counts per directory:

```bash
for dir in commands skills agents hooks scripts doc; do
  echo "$dir: $(find "$DST/$dir" -type f | wc -l) files"
done
echo "CLAUDE.md: 1 file"
```

## Important rules

- **Never copy from public to private.** This is strictly one-direction.
- **Never skip Step 1.** The safety scan is mandatory every time.
- **Never auto-confirm.** Always wait for explicit user approval after the scan.
