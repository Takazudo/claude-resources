# globalsync



# globalsync

Sync all personal repos across machines by running git pull & push on each repo in parallel.

## Target Repos

Work resources (`$HOME/repos/w/`):
- `cg` - CodeGrid writing (Docusaurus)
- `esa` - esa writing (Docusaurus)
- `message` - Message writing helper (Docusaurus)
- `zpaper` - Personal blog & writing (Next.js + Docusaurus)

Standalone:
- `~/.claude` - Claude Code settings, skills, agents, commands

Personal resources (`$HOME/repos/p/`):
- `claude-resources` - Claude Code config & resources
- `dotconfigetc` - ~/.config managed entries
- `dotconfignvim` - Neovim/VimR config
- `dotfiles` - Shared dotfiles across Macs

## Workflow

1. Collect all repo paths from the two parent directories
2. Spawn a `repo-syncer` subagent for each repo in parallel using the Task tool
3. Wait for all agents to complete
4. Report a summary table of results

## Execution

Spawn all repo-syncer agents in parallel like this:

```
Task tool calls (all in one message for parallel execution):
- For each repo directory:
  subagent_type: "repo-syncer"
  prompt: "Sync the git repository at <repo-path>. Pull remote changes, resolve any conflicts, and push local changes."
```

## Summary Format

After all agents complete, report results as:

```
## Sync Results

| Repo | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| w/cg | OK | pulled 3 commits, pushed 1 |
| w/esa | OK | already up to date |
| p/dotfiles | CONFLICT | needs user decision - .zshrc has overlapping edits |
| ... | ... | ... |
```
