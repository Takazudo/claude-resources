# Apply CodeGrid Voice

Apply Takazudo's **CodeGrid** writing voice and vocabulary rules to incoming text.

## Voice Character Summary

The CodeGrid voice is a **polite but approachable technical article** style. Sits between formal tech writing and casual blogging — です/ます base with conversational warmth. The author shares from personal experience, hedges assertions, and engages in dialogue with the reader.

Key traits:
- **Experienced but humble** — veteran developer who avoids overstatement
- **Self-reference**: 「自分」for personal experience, 「筆者」for authorial stance, 「私」for emphatic opinions
- **Sentence endings**: 〜と考えています / 〜と感じています / 〜のではないでしょうか / 〜かと思います / 〜わけでして
- **Heavy hedging**: 〜かもしれない / 〜のではないか / 〜かと思われます / おそらく〜 / 〜という感覚があります
- **Everyday analogies** — explain tech concepts via relatable examples (egg cookers, game buffs)
- **Reader dialogue** — anticipate reader reactions, address them proactively
- **Emphasis**: Bold + parenthetical (まったくもってなりません（重要）), katakana emphasis (超スゴイ, ガンガン, サラっと)
- **Connections**: ただ (soft contrast) / ですが (polite contrast) / さて〜 (topic shift) / 前回は〜 (continuity)
- **Avoid**: Consecutive 〜です/〜である / stiff literary style / condescending tone / abstract explanations without personal experience / conclusions without reflection

### Contrast with esa voice

| Aspect | CodeGrid | esa |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Tone | Polite but approachable tech article | Casual colleague memo |
| Formality | Medium (です/ます base) | Low (断片的OK) |
| Self-reference | 自分 / 筆者 / 私 | 自分 / Takazudo |
| Stance | Writing for readers | Sharing with coworkers |
| Hedging style | Explicit softening (〜かと思います, 〜のではないでしょうか) | Understatement (〜の模様, 〜良さそう) |
| Structure | Considered, essay-like | Loose, memo-like |

## When to Use

- User provides text and wants it written/rewritten in Takazudo's **CodeGrid** voice
- User says "codegrid voice", "codegrid文体で", "codegrid風に書いて" etc.
- User wants to check or fix text to conform to the CodeGrid writing style

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the rule files

**Always** read both rule files fresh at invocation time:

1. `/Users/takazudo/repos/work/takazudo-codegrid-writing/doc/docs/overview/writing-style.md`
2. `/Users/takazudo/repos/work/takazudo-codegrid-writing/doc/docs/overview/vocabulary-rule.md`

These files are the authoritative source of truth. Read them every time to pick up any updates.

### Step 2: Identify the input text

The input text comes from one of:
- Text provided directly in the conversation (before or after the skill invocation)
- $ARGUMENTS passed with the command
- A file path the user points to

If no text is obvious, ask the user what text they want the voice applied to.

### Step 3: Apply the rules

Transform or review the text using the voice character described above and the full details in the rule files. The rule files are the authority — the summary above is just for quick reference.

### Step 4: Output the result

Output the transformed text. If the input was already close to the style, note what minor adjustments were made.

If reviewing existing text (rather than transforming), point out specific violations and suggest fixes.

## Important Notes

- This skill transforms **text style/voice** only — it does not change the content or meaning
- The skill works on Japanese text. If English text is provided, translate to Japanese in the CodeGrid voice
- If $ARGUMENTS contains text, treat that as the input text to transform
- When in doubt about a style choice, refer back to the rule files — they are the authority
- The rules may be updated over time, which is why we re-read them every invocation
