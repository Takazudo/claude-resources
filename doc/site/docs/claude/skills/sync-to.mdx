# sync-to

Merge the current branch into a specified target branch, push if remote exists, then return to the original branch. The source branch remains intact.

## Usage

Run the bundled script:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/sync-to/scripts/sync-to.sh $ARGUMENTS
```

Report the script output to the user verbatim. Do not add extra commentary unless there was an error.

## Conflict handling

If the script exits with a merge conflict error, immediately stop and ask the user to use `/sync-force-to` instead. Do not attempt to resolve conflicts manually.
