# Articlify for CodeGrid

Convert the current conversation into a CodeGrid article by crafting a detailed writing brief and delegating to the `zudocg-writer` subagent.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather context from conversation

Review the conversation history and identify:
- What topic was discussed
- What was tried (approaches A, B, C...)
- What worked and what didn't
- Key technical details, code snippets, commands
- The conclusion or final approach taken
- Any opinions or insights expressed
- **Images**: Any images attached to the conversation (screenshots, diagrams, etc.)

### Step 1.5: Handle images (if any)

If images were provided in the conversation (attached screenshots, diagrams, etc.):

1. **Determine the series name** (e.g., `ai-agent`, `2025-html-selectbox`)
2. **Create the image directory** in the codegrid repo:
   ```
   mkdir -p $HOME/repos/w/cg/doc/static/img/{series-name}/
   ```
3. **Copy each image** to that directory with a descriptive filename:
   ```
   cp /path/to/source/image.png $HOME/repos/w/cg/doc/static/img/{series-name}/descriptive-name.png
   ```
4. **Record the image paths** for the writing brief. The markdown reference format is:
   ```
   ![alt text](/img/{series-name}/descriptive-name.png)
   ```

### Step 2: Craft the writing brief

Create a **detailed, self-contained prompt** that the writer subagent can use without any conversation context. The brief must include:

1. **Article topic**: Clear one-line description
2. **Series info**: Which series this belongs to (existing or new), article number
3. **Background**: Why this was done, what motivated it
4. **Story arc**: The journey (tried X, it failed because Y, then tried Z which worked)
5. **Technical details**: Specific code, commands, configurations, error messages
6. **Key points to cover**: Bullet list of must-include content
7. **Images**: If images were copied in Step 1.5, list each with its markdown path and a description of what it shows and where it should be placed in the article
8. **Conclusion**: What was the outcome, what was learned
9. **Tone guidance**: Any specific angle or framing (if applicable)

The brief should be written so that someone with zero context could write the full article from it alone.

### Step 3: Delegate to subagent

Use the Task tool to spawn the `zudocg-writer` subagent:

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: zudocg-writer
  prompt: [the detailed writing brief from Step 2]
```

The subagent will:
- Read the repo's writing style guides
- Write the article in Japanese following CodeGrid conventions
- Save to the correct series directory
- For new series: create `_category_.json` with descending position (`99999999 - YYYYMMDD`) so newer series appear first
- Run formatting checks

### Step 4: Report back

After the subagent completes, report:
- The file path of the created article
- A brief summary of what was written

## Important Notes

- The writing brief is the ONLY context the subagent receives - make it thorough
- Include actual code snippets, error messages, and command outputs in the brief
- CodeGrid articles are part of a series - clarify which series and episode number
- If the conversation involved multiple topics, ask the user which one to articlify
- **Images must be copied BEFORE delegating** - the subagent cannot see conversation images
- Include the full markdown image reference paths in the brief so the subagent can embed them
- $ARGUMENTS can provide additional guidance on focus or angle
