# Commits Forbid

From now on, do NOT make commits automatically. Making commits without explicit user permission is not allowed. Only commit when the user explicitly asks (e.g., via `/commits`).

This mode is for try-and-error development where the user is exploring different implementation directions and doesn't want intermediate work committed.
