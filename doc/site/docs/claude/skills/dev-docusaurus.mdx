# Docusaurus Development Fixes

Tiny but important configuration tweaks for Docusaurus v3.x projects that prevent annoying warnings and build errors.

## Fix 1: Suppress Broken Link Warnings for Generated Docs

When docs are auto-generated from external sources (e.g., Claude Code skills, API specs), they often contain internal references (`references/foo.md`) that don't resolve in Docusaurus. These warnings are noise.

In `docusaurus.config.ts` (or `.js`):

```js
const config = {
  // Suppress broken link errors for generated docs with internal references
  onBrokenLinks: "ignore",

  markdown: {
    // v4-compatible location for onBrokenMarkdownLinks
    hooks: {
      onBrokenMarkdownLinks: "ignore",
    },
  },
};
```

**Important:** Do NOT use the top-level `onBrokenMarkdownLinks` option — it is deprecated since Docusaurus v3.6+ and will be removed in v4. Always place it under `markdown.hooks.onBrokenMarkdownLinks` instead.

## Fix 2: Explicit Dependencies for pnpm + Swizzled Components

When swizzling Docusaurus theme components (e.g., `DocItem/Content`) under **pnpm**, imports like `@docusaurus/theme-common` and `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs/client` fail with "Module not found" because pnpm's strict dependency resolution doesn't hoist transitive deps from `@docusaurus/preset-classic`.

Fix: install them explicitly.

```bash
pnpm add @docusaurus/theme-common @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs
```

This is only needed when the project uses pnpm AND has swizzled components that import from these packages. npm/yarn hoist these automatically.
