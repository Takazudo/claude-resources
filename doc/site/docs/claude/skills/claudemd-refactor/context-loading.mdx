# How Claude Code Loads CLAUDE.md Context

## Automatic Loading Behavior

Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md files automatically based on the working directory:

1. **Root CLAUDE.md** (`/CLAUDE.md` or `/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) — ALWAYS loaded at conversation start
2. **Subdirectory CLAUDE.md** — loaded when Claude works on files in or below that directory
3. **Multiple levels** — if working on `src/components/Button.tsx`, Claude loads:
   - `/CLAUDE.md`
   - `/src/CLAUDE.md` (if exists)
   - `/src/components/CLAUDE.md` (if exists)

## What "Loaded" Means

- Content is injected into Claude's context window automatically
- No tool call (Read) is needed — the content is just there
- This is why inline content in CLAUDE.md is the most reliable approach

## Context Window Considerations

- Every CLAUDE.md adds to the context window usage
- Very large CLAUDE.md files reduce available context for actual work
- Balance: enough info to be useful, not so much it crowds out working context
- Rule of thumb: root CLAUDE.md should be under ~200 lines for most projects
- Directory-scoped files should be under ~100 lines each

## Reliability Explanation

### Highest: Inline in CLAUDE.md
- Automatically loaded, always in context
- Claude sees it before doing any work
- Zero chance of missing it

### High: Directory-scoped CLAUDE.md
- Automatically loaded when working in that directory
- Only risk: if Claude works on a file from outside its directory context
- Very reliable for directory-specific rules

### Medium: Explicit "read before doing X"
- Requires Claude to follow the instruction and use Read tool
- Claude usually follows explicit instructions but may occasionally skip
- Better for large reference docs that would bloat CLAUDE.md

### Low: Passive "refer to file"
- Claude may or may not read the file
- Depends on whether Claude thinks it's relevant to the current task
- Only use for truly optional supplementary info
