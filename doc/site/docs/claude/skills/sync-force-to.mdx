# sync-force-to

Overwrite a remote target branch with the current branch by deleting the remote target and re-pushing. Avoids `git push --force` by using delete + push instead.

## Usage

Run the bundled script:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/sync-force-to/scripts/sync-force-to.sh $ARGUMENTS
```

Report the script output to the user verbatim. Do not add extra commentary unless there was an error.
