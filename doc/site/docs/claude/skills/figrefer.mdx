# Figma Refer

Read the user's current Figma desktop app selection and work with it based on their instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Figma Desktop MCP must be connected: `claude mcp add --transport http figma-desktop http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`
- Figma desktop app open with Dev Mode enabled (Shift+D)
- User has selected a layer/frame in Figma

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the Selection

Call these tools in parallel (no nodeId needed — reads current selection):

- `mcp__figma-desktop__get_screenshot` - visual reference
- `mcp__figma-desktop__get_design_context` - code reference with styles, fonts, colors
- `mcp__figma-desktop__get_metadata` - structure, dimensions, positions

### Step 2: Present What You See

Summarize the selection for the user:

- What the element looks like (from screenshot)
- Dimensions and position (from metadata)
- Key style properties: fonts, colors, spacing (from design context)
- Layer structure if relevant

### Step 3: Follow User Instructions

`$ARGUMENTS` contains what the user wants to do. Common scenarios:

- **"implement this"** - Generate code matching the design, adapted to the current project's stack
- **"what is this"** - Describe the element's properties in detail
- **"use this style for..."** - Extract style values and apply them
- **"compare with my code"** - Read the user's code and compare against the Figma design
- **No argument** - Just show what's selected and ask what they'd like to do

## Important Notes

- The design context returns React+Tailwind as a reference. Always adapt to the project's actual framework and styling system.
- If the selection is too large, `get_design_context` may return only metadata. Use `get_metadata` to find specific child node IDs, then call `get_design_context` on those.
- Use `get_variable_defs` (via `mcp__figma-desktop__get_variable_defs`) if the user asks about design tokens or variables.
- Images from desktop MCP are served from `http://localhost:3845/assets/...` and can be used directly in code.
