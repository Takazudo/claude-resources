# ASCII Circuit Diagram Golden Rules

These rules ensure clear, unambiguous ASCII circuit diagrams.

## Rule 1: Never Cross Lines Without Junctions

**❌ WRONG** - Lines crossing without junction (ambiguous):
```
Signal A  ──┼──  (is this connected or just passing?)
            │
         Signal B
```

**✅ CORRECT** - Route around to avoid crossing:
```
Signal A  ────────  (clearly not connected)

         Signal B
            │
```

**✅ CORRECT** - Use explicit junction when signals DO connect:
```
Signal A  ──┬──  (T-junction: A and B connect here)
            │
         Signal B
```

## Rule 2: Never Cross Lines Over Text Labels

When a vertical or horizontal line passes over a text label, it creates ambiguity.

**❌ WRONG** - Lines crossing over labels:
```
Output ──┬──→ Load
         │
        GND      ← Label
         │       ← Is this line connected to GND label?
        C1
```

**✅ CORRECT** - Remove intermediate labels:
```
Output ──┬──→ Load
         │
         ├─→ C1 ─→ GND
            470µF
```

**Solutions:**
1. Route lines around labels
2. Remove intermediate labels that would be crossed
3. **Route vertically in opposite direction** - If downward line crosses labels, route upward

## Rule 3: Use Label Notation for Distant Connections

When connections would require crossing wires, use arrow-to-label notation:

**✅ CORRECT**:
```
IC Pin ├2─→ Tap      ← Pin points to "Tap" label (no wire drawn)

Output ─┬─→ R1 ──┬─→ Tap ─→ R2 ─→ GND
        │         ↑
        │    This "Tap" matches the label above
```

Examples:
- `FB ├2─→ Tap` means "FB pin 2 connects to the point labeled 'Tap'"
- `GND ├1─→ GND` means "GND pin 1 connects to system ground"

### Use "GND" Label Often (Important Practice)

**Best Practice**: In circuit design, use "GND" as a label frequently instead of drawing every ground connection.

**Why**:
- GND connections are extremely common in circuits
- Trying to express every GND connection accurately makes diagrams messy and cluttered
- Using `→ GND` notation keeps diagrams clean and readable

**✅ CORRECT** - Use GND labels to avoid clutter:
```
┌──────────────┐
│   U2 (IC)    │
│              │
│      VOUT 4  ├────→ Output
│              │
│      GND 1   ├────→ GND
└──────────────┘

┌──────────┐
│   D1     │
│ Diode    ├────→ GND
└──────────┘

┌──────────┐
│   C3     │
│  470µF   ├────→ GND
└──────────┘
```

**❌ WRONG** - Trying to draw all GND connections creates mess:
```
                                                      ┌──────────┐
┌──────────────┐                                     │   D1     │
│   U2 (IC)    │                                     │ Diode    │
│              │                                     └────┬─────┘
│      VOUT 4  ├────→ Output                              │
│              │                                          │
│      GND 1   ├──────────┬───────────┬──────────────────┴───────┐
└──────────────┘          │           │                          │
                          │      ┌────┴───┐                      │
                          │      │   C3   │                      │
                          │      │  470µF │                      │
                          │      └────┬───┘                      │
                          │           │                          │
┌──────────┐              │           │                          │
│   GND    ├──────────────┴───────────┴──────────────────────────┘
└──────────┘
```
The second version is cluttered and hard to follow!

**When to use GND label**:
- Component ground pins → `─→ GND`
- Capacitor/resistor bottom terminals → `─→ GND`
- Diode anodes (in flyback positions) → `─→ GND`
- Any component that needs ground connection

**Exception**: When showing a specific ground topology is important (e.g., star ground, ground loops), draw the actual connections. For most circuit diagrams, labels are clearer.

## Rule 4: Show Parallel Components as Vertical Drops

Components connected in parallel (between signal and GND) should be drawn vertically:

**✅ CORRECT** - Single capacitor:
```
Output ──┬──→ Load
         │
        C1 (470µF)   ← Clearly parallel
         │
        GND
```

**✅ BEST PRACTICE** - Multiple parallel capacitors (filter pairs):
```
Power ──┬────────────────┬─── To IC
        │                │
       C1               C2
      100nF            470µF
     ceramic        electrolytic
     (CLOSE!)        (farther)
        │                │
       GND              GND
```
Key points:
- T-junction (┬) at TOP on the power rail
- Capacitor labels in the middle of vertical lines
- Clean vertical drops to GND (no extra junctions at bottom)
- **Left-to-right order**: Ceramic (CLOSE to IC) on LEFT, electrolytic (farther) on RIGHT
- Can show physical placement hints (ceramic close to IC, electrolytic farther)
- Common in power supply designs (bulk + decoupling capacitor pairs)

**❌ WRONG** - Looks like series:
```
Output ── C1 ── Load   ← Confusing! Looks like C1 blocks current
```

**❌ WRONG** - Junction at bottom instead of top:
```
        C1               C2
         │                │
Power ──┴────────────────┴───
         │                │
        GND              GND
```
This makes it look like the junction is at GND, not at the power rail!

## Box-Drawing Character Reference

### Basic Junctions (Most Common)

| Symbol | Code | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| `├` | 251C | T-junction right - signal branches to the right |
| `┤` | 2524 | T-junction left - signal branches to the left |
| `┬` | 252C | T-junction down - signal splits downward |
| `┴` | 2534 | T-junction up - signal merges from below |

### Lines

| Symbol | Code | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| `─` | 2500 | Horizontal trace (standard signals) |
| `━` | 2501 | Heavy horizontal (power rails, main paths) |
| `│` | 2502 | Vertical trace (standard signals) |
| `┃` | 2503 | Heavy vertical (power rails, main paths) |
| `═` | 2550 | Double horizontal (differential pairs, parallel conductors) |
| `║` | 2551 | Double vertical (differential pairs, parallel conductors) |

### Corners

| Symbol | Code | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| `┌` | 250C | Corner down-right |
| `┐` | 2510 | Corner down-left |
| `└` | 2514 | Corner up-right |
| `┘` | 2518 | Corner up-left |
| `┏` | 250F | Heavy corner down-right (power) |
| `┓` | 2513 | Heavy corner down-left (power) |
| `┗` | 2517 | Heavy corner up-right (power) |
| `┛` | 251B | Heavy corner up-left (power) |

### Cross Junctions

| Symbol | Code | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| `┼` | 253C | **AVOID** - Ambiguous 4-way cross |
| `╋` | 254B | Heavy cross - only if truly 4-way connection |

**Note**: Avoid `┼` and `╋` unless all 4 directions genuinely connect. Use T-junctions instead for clarity.

## Rule 6: Use Unicode Characters for Clarity

**Why Unicode is BETTER than ASCII**:
- **Box-drawing**: `├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘` show exact junction direction - unambiguous
- **Arrows**: `→ ←` are standard directional symbols
- **ASCII `+`** is ambiguous - could connect in any direction
- Clear visual topology prevents false junction errors
- Easier to trace signal paths in preview

**Best practice: Use full Unicode character set**

**✅ CORRECT** - Unicode throughout:
```
Output ──┬─→ Load
         │
        C1 (470µF)
         │
        GND
```
The `┬` clearly shows: connects down AND horizontally to Load
The `→` clearly shows signal direction

**❌ WRONG** - ASCII `+` creates ambiguous junctions:
```
Output --+-> Load
         |
        C1 (470uF)
         |
        GND
```
The `+` is ambiguous - does it connect left? Right? Up? Down? All directions?

**CRITICAL**: Using ASCII `+` for junctions was the cause of false junction errors where CC1/CC2 appeared connected to capacitor lines when they shouldn't be!

## Rule 7: Use Boxes to Identify Components

**Purpose**: Boxes visually identify individual components and group their labels/values together.

**Rule**: Draw a box around each component (IC, capacitor, resistor, connector, etc.)

**✅ CORRECT** - Each component has its own box with proper padding:
```
     ┌──────┐
─────┤ C1   ├─────
     │ 10µF │
     └──────┘
```
The box makes it clear: "This is C1, value 10µF"

**✅ CORRECT** - Box has enough width for content with padding:
```
┌───────────────┐
│ GND (B12,A12) ├──────
└───────────────┘
```

**❌ WRONG** - Floating text is ambiguous:
```
     C1
      │
─────┴─────
    10µF
```
Which line is C1? What does 10µF refer to?

**❌ WRONG** - Box too narrow, text touches borders:
```
┌─────────────┐
│GND (B12,A12)├──────
└─────────────┘
```

**Key points**:
- **One box per component** - don't group multiple components
- **Box should have enough width** - Include at least 1 space padding on each side of the text inside the box
- Box contains: component designator (U1, C1, R1) and value/type
- For ICs: show pin numbers inside the box
- For connectors: show pin names inside the box
- Makes component identification immediate and unambiguous

## Rule 8: Separate Complicated Layouts

**Problem**: When circuit details become complicated within a diagram, they create clutter and reduce clarity.

**Rule**: When a complicated layout occurs in a diagram, separate the layout into a new diagram block.

**✅ CORRECT** - Separate LED circuit detail:

Main diagram shows:
```
│10. PG       ───────┼─→ See LED circuit below
```

Separate detailed diagram:
```
### LED Status Indicator Circuit

┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ +5V Rail    │     │   R1    │     │  LED1    │
│ (from D7)   ├─────┤  330Ω   ├─────┤  Green   ├─────┐
└─────────────┘     └─────────┘     └──────────┘     │
                                                      │
                                    ┌────────────────────┐
                                    │   U1 (CH224Q)      │
                                    │10. PG (Open-drain) │
                                    └────────┬───────────┘
                                             │
                                            GND
```

**❌ WRONG** - Trying to cram detail into main diagram:
```
│10. PG       ───────┼─→ LED (via +5V+330Ω)
```
This is unclear - where does +5V come from? How is the LED connected?

**When to separate:**
- Circuit detail involves components from other diagrams (e.g., +5V from a different stage)
- Layout would require crossing multiple signal paths
- Detail would make the main diagram too wide or cluttered
- Circuit needs explanation of operation (e.g., open-drain, pull-up/pull-down)

**Benefits:**
- Main diagram stays clean and focused on primary connections
- Detail diagram shows full circuit topology with all components
- Easier to understand both overview and implementation
- Can add notes explaining operation without cluttering main diagram

## Rule 9: Separate Functional Blocks for Complex Circuits

**Best Practice**: For complex circuits (buck converters, voltage inverters, multi-stage circuits), break the diagram into clearly labeled functional sections.

**Layout principles:**
1. **Branch right, then down** - Use `└───` to create branches that extend right first, then go vertical
2. **Main flow horizontal, branches vertical** - Keep signal flow left-to-right, use vertical lines for branches to GND or parallel components
3. **One function per section** - IC, switching node, input caps, feedback network, etc.

**✅ CORRECT** - Separated sections with clear labels:
```
LM2596S-ADJ IC:
                    ┌──────────────┐
-15V ───────────────┤1 VIN     OUT 2├───── SW Node
                    │              │
                 ┌──┤3 GND      FB 4├──── FB Tap
                 │  │              │
                GND │    5 ON/OFF  │
                    │   (floating) │
                    └──────────────┘

Switching Node and Inductor:
                                 ┌─────────────┐
SW Node ────────────┬────────────┤ L3 (100µH)  ├──────────── -13.5V OUT
                    │            └─────────────┘
                    │
                    └─── D3 (SS34 Schottky)
                         Cathode
                            │
                         Anode
                            │
                           GND

Input Filter Capacitors:
-15V ───┬─── To VIN
        │
        ├─ C9 (100µF electrolytic)
        │    │  ※ Negative to -15V, Positive to GND
        │   GND
        │
        └─ C10 (100nF ceramic)
             │
            GND
```

**Key benefits:**
- **No line crossings** between different functional blocks
- **Crystal clear** component grouping
- **Easy to trace** signal paths within each section
- **Simple branching** using `└───` (right first, then down) or `┬` (split, then vertical)
- **Easy to modify** individual sections without affecting others

**When to use separated sections:**
- Complex circuits with >5 components
- Circuits where components serve distinct functions
- Any time a single-diagram layout would require crossing lines over labels
- Buck/boost converters (IC + switching node + filters + feedback)
- Multi-stage circuits (inverter + regulator + protection)

**❌ WRONG** - Trying to cram everything into one diagram:
```
-15V ───┬──────────────────────┤1 VIN   OUT 2├───┬─── L3 ───┬─→ -13.5V
        │                      │            │    │          │
        ├─ C9 ──┬             │ LM2596S    │    │          │
        │       │              │            │    │          │
        │      GND          ┌──┤3 GND   FB 4├─┐  │ D3       │
        │                   │  │            │ │  │  │       │
        └─ C10 ──┬         GND │  5 ON/OFF  │ │  ├──┘       │
                 │              └────────────┘ │  │          │
                GND                            │ GND         │
                                               │             │
-13.5V ─────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────┤
                                               │             │
                                            R5 ─┴─ R6 ── GND
```
This creates:
- Lines crossing over labels (C9, C10, D3 cross multiple text labels)
- Ambiguous junctions (is D3 connected to everything?)
- Hard to trace signal paths
- Difficult to modify without breaking layout

## Rule 10: No Flying/Disconnected Lines

**Problem**: Vertical lines must maintain exact column alignment throughout their entire path. If the column position shifts even by one character, the line appears to "float" or disconnect.

**❌ WRONG** - Line appears disconnected (off by 1 space):
```
└──────────┘     │
                                                      │  ← Shifted right by 1
                                    ┌────────────────────┐
```

**✅ CORRECT** - Perfect column alignment:
```
└──────────┘     │
                                                     │  ← Same column position
                                    ┌────────────────────┐
```

**Critical**: These subtle misalignments are often invisible in plain text but become obvious in monospace preview. **Always preview and carefully inspect vertical line alignment before finalizing.**

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Preview in monospace** - Alignment issues become visible
2. **Trace each vertical line** - Follow from start to end, checking every row
3. **Count character positions** - Verify exact column numbers if needed
4. **Look for "broken" appearance** - Lines that seem to disconnect or float
5. **Fix immediately** - Adjust spacing to restore perfect alignment

**Common causes**:
- Labels with different character widths pushing lines around
- Manual spacing adjustments that shift subsequent lines
- Copy-paste errors that don't preserve exact spacing
- Forgetting to count junction symbols as part of the vertical path

### Example: Capacitor Legs - Show Both Connections

**❌ WRONG** - Only 1 leg visible (only shows connection to +15V):
```
                 ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐
                 │  C5  │ │  C6  │
                 │ 100µF│ │100nF │
                 └──┬───┘ └──┬───┘
┌──────────┐        │        │
│ +15V In  ├────────┴────────┴────
```
Problem: Each capacitor only shows 1 line from the box. Capacitors have 2 legs!

**❌ ALSO WRONG** - Flying lines with gap:
```
                 ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐
                 │  C5  │ │  C6  │
                 │ 100µF│ │100nF │
                 └──┬───┘ └──┬───┘
                    │        │
                    │        │      ← Gap! Lines are floating!
┌──────────┐        │        │
│ +15V In  ├────────┴────────┴────
```

**✅ CORRECT** - Show both legs (one visual, one with → GND notation):
```
                 ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐
            GND←─│  C5  │ │  C6  │─→GND
                 │ 100µF│ │100nF │
                 └──┬───┘ └───┬──┘
┌──────────┐        │         │
│ +15V In  ├────────┴─────────┴────
```
Now each capacitor shows 2 legs:
- Side: `GND←─` or `─→GND` (arrow notation for GND connection)
- Bottom: Visual line to +15V
- No gaps between box and +15V line

### Example: Don't Label Every Junction

**❌ WRONG** - Labeling obvious junction points (like writing "Junction" everywhere):
```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────┐               ┌─────┐
│   Out    ├─────┤ R1  ├──┬── Tap ─────┤ R2  ├─→ GND
└──────────┘     └─────┘  │            └─────┘
                           │
                         ┌────┐
                         │ FB │
                         └────┘
```
The "Tap" label is useless here - it's obvious this is a connection point.

**✅ CORRECT** - Only label when needed for distant references:
```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐
│   Out    ├─────┤ R1  ├──┬──┤ R2  ├─→ GND
└──────────┘     └─────┘  │  └─────┘
                           │
                         ┌────┐
                         │ FB │
                         └────┘
```

**When to use labels**: Only when referencing from a distant part of the diagram (e.g., `FB ├2─→ Tap` in main diagram, then show actual circuit in separate diagram).

### Example: Box Connection Alignment

**Problem**: When connecting vertical lines to boxes, the junction must be IN the box border, not beside it.

**❌ WRONG** - Line beside box (misaligned):
```
     │
┌────────┐
│   C3   │
│  470µF │
└────────┘
     │
```
The vertical lines appear disconnected from the box!

**✅ CORRECT** - Junction IN the box border:
```
     │
┌────┴───┐
│   C3   │
│  470µF │
└────┬───┘
     │
```
Use `┴` (top) and `┬` (bottom) to replace part of the border and show the connection point.

**Rule**: When a vertical line connects to a box's top or bottom:
- Replace `─` in the top border with `┴` (T-junction down)
- Replace `─` in the bottom border with `┬` (T-junction up)

**Note**: This is a common alignment issue that could be automatically detected and fixed by a linting script. The pattern is consistent: any vertical line above/below a box should have a junction symbol in the box border.

## Column Alignment

Maintain consistent column positioning for vertical bars:

**❌ WRONG** - Lines slide because labels have different widths:
```
            │
           GND    ← 3 characters
            │
           C3     ← 2 characters
            │     ← Lines appear to "slide"
```

**✅ CORRECT** - Maintain same column:
```
            │
           GND
            │
           C3
          470µF
            │
```

## Component Notation

- **ICs**: Use part numbers (CH224D, LM2596S, etc.)
- **Passives**: Show values with units (10µF, 5.1kΩ, 33µH) OR use notation if values break alignment
- **Voltages**: Show at each stage (+15V, +13.5V, +12V)
- **Currents**: Show max ratings (1.2A, 800mA)

**Component Value Placement**:

When component values fit cleanly:
```
            |
           GND
            |
           C3
          470uF
            |
```

When values break column alignment, use text notation instead:
```
            |
           GND
            |
           C3
            |
```

Then list values after the diagram:
```
Component values:
  C3: 470uF
  R1: 10kΩ
  L1: 100uH
```

**Guideline**: If adding a value label shifts the vertical line position, use text notation instead.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any diagram:

1. ✅ No line crossings without explicit junctions
2. ✅ No lines crossing over text labels
3. ✅ All components properly connected (no floating components)
4. ✅ Parallel components shown as vertical drops to GND
5. ✅ Diode polarity correct (cathode/anode orientation)
6. ✅ ASCII-only characters used (no Unicode box-drawing or arrows)
7. ✅ No flying/disconnected lines (vertical lines maintain column alignment)
8. ✅ Consistent column alignment (no sliding vertical bars)
9. ✅ Label notation used for distant connections
10. ✅ Preview verified in monospace rendering
