# Tweak Existing Skill

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the skill

Find skills at:
- `~/.claude/skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md` (personal)
- `.claude/skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md` (project)

Read the SKILL.md and any referenced files (scripts/, references/, assets/).

### Step 2: Diagnose the issue

Common problems and fixes:

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Skill not triggering | Poor `description` | Rewrite with clear trigger keywords and scenarios |
| Skill triggers too often | Description too broad | Make description more specific; add `disable-model-invocation: true` for manual-only |
| Skill not visible | Exceeds character budget | Run `/context` to check; shorten description or increase `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` |
| Wrong agent used in fork | `agent:` field incorrect | Change to correct agent name |
| Forked skill lacks context | Missing instructions | Skill content IS the prompt in fork mode - make it self-contained |
| Script fails | Bug or environment issue | Read and test the script |

### Step 3: Apply changes

**Frontmatter fields reference:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Skill name (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars) |
| `description` | What it does + when to use. Primary trigger mechanism |
| `disable-model-invocation` | `true` = manual only via `/skill-name` |
| `user-invocable` | `false` = hidden from `/` menu, Claude can still auto-invoke |
| `argument-hint` | Hint in autocomplete (e.g., `[filename]`) |
| `allowed-tools` | Tools allowed without permission when active |
| `model` | Model override when active |
| `context` | `fork` = run in isolated subagent context |
| `agent` | Agent type for fork: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or custom agent name |
| `hooks` | Lifecycle hooks |

**Substitution variables:** `$ARGUMENTS`, `$0`, `$1`, `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`

**Dynamic injection:** Use the exclamation-backtick pattern (e.g. exclamation + backtick-wrapped command) to run shell commands before skill content is sent to Claude.

### Step 4: Format SKILL.md

Format the edited SKILL.md file using the mdx-formatter to ensure consistent markdown formatting:

```bash
pnpm dlx @takazudo/mdx-formatter --write <path-to-SKILL.md>
```

### Step 5: Verify

After editing:
1. YAML frontmatter parses without errors
2. Description matches intended trigger scenarios
3. Referenced files (scripts, references) exist and are correct
4. For forked skills: content is self-contained (no conversation history available)
5. SKILL.md body stays under 500 lines

## Progressive Disclosure Reminder

If SKILL.md is getting too long (approaching 500 lines):
- Move detailed content to `references/` files
- Keep only core workflow and navigation in SKILL.md
- Reference split files clearly: "See [filename](references/filename.md) for details"
