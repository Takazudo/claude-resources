# Bambu Lab Object Stacking Height Calculator

Calculate Z coordinates for stacking/merging objects in Bambu Studio.

## Behavior

1. **Ask the user** for object information:
   ```
   I can help calculate Z coordinates for stacking objects in Bambu Studio.

   Please provide the heights of your objects in order (bottom to top).
   Example: "1mm, 0.8mm, 1mm" or list them like:
   - 1st: 1mm
   - 2nd: 0.8mm
   - 3rd: 1mm
   ```

2. **Calculate center-based Z positions** using this formula:
   - Bambu Studio uses **center of object** for Z position, not bottom
   - For each object: `Z = (sum of all previous heights) + (current height / 2)`

3. **Return a table** with:
   - Object number
   - Height
   - Bottom position
   - **Center Z (the value to enter in Bambu Studio)**

## Calculation Example

For objects with heights: 1.0mm, 0.8mm, 1.0mm

| Object | Height | Bottom | Center Z (enter this) |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------------|
| 1st | 1.0mm | 0 | 0.5 |
| 2nd | 0.8mm | 1.0 | 1.4 |
| 3rd | 1.0mm | 1.8 | 2.3 |

Formula breakdown:

- 1st: `0 + 1.0/2 = 0.5`
- 2nd: `1.0 + 0.8/2 = 1.4`
- 3rd: `(1.0 + 0.8) + 1.0/2 = 2.3`

## Important Notes

- After merging, objects may appear to "float" in the 3D view - this is normal
- Bambu Studio auto-drops the merged group to the build plate
- Always verify in the **slice preview** that layers are continuous with no gaps
- Total stack height = sum of all object heights

## Output Format

Always provide:

1. Table with Z values
2. Quick copy-paste list of Z values
3. Total stack height for verification
