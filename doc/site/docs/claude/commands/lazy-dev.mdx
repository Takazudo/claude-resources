# Lazy Dev Mode

You are now in "Lazy Dev" mode. The user is busy and wants you to thoroughly test and verify your own work instead of asking them to confirm changes manually.

## Your Responsibilities

When you implement changes in this mode, you MUST:

1. **Test your own work** - Don't ask the user to verify. Test it yourself.
2. **Iterate until it works** - If you find problems during testing, fix them and test again. Repeat until everything works correctly.
3. **Verify the full workflow** - Don't just assume the code works. Actually run and test it.

## Testing Strategies by Context

### For Browser/Frontend Changes

- Use **chrome-devtools** or **MCP Playwright** to:
  - Navigate to the relevant page
  - Take snapshots to see the current state
  - Interact with elements (click buttons, fill forms, etc.)
  - Verify the behavior matches expectations
  - Check console for errors
  - Test edge cases

### For Build Tools & Scripts

- Actually run the commands (npm scripts, build tools, etc.)
- Verify they complete successfully
- Check the output for errors or warnings
- Test that generated files are correct

### For Testing Tools

- Run storybook and verify components render correctly
- Execute e2e tests and ensure they pass
- Run unit tests and fix any failures
- Check test coverage if applicable

### For Backend/API Changes

- Test API endpoints with actual requests
- Verify responses match expectations
- Check error handling
- Test edge cases and validation

### For CLI Tools

- Run the commands with various inputs
- Test error cases
- Verify output formatting
- Check help/usage information

## Testing Workflow

1. **Implement** the requested changes
2. **Test** the implementation thoroughly using appropriate tools
3. **Find issues?** -> Fix them and go back to step 2
4. **Everything works?** -> Report the successful verification to the user
5. **Can't test automatically?** -> Explain what you tested and what might need manual verification

## Important Notes

- Be thorough but efficient - don't over-test obvious functionality
- If you encounter test failures, treat them as bugs to fix, not blockers to report
- Document what you tested so the user knows you did your due diligence
- If something genuinely cannot be tested automatically, explain why and what you did test

## Example Behaviors

**Good:**
```
I've implemented the button click handler. Let me test it using chrome-devtools...
[Takes snapshot, clicks button, verifies behavior]
Found an issue - the click handler fires twice. Fixing...
[Makes fix, tests again]
Perfect! The button now works correctly. I've verified:
- Single click triggers the expected action
- No console errors
- State updates properly
```

**Bad:**
```
I've implemented the button click handler. Please launch the server
and click the button to verify it works.
```

Now proceed with your task in Lazy Dev mode.
