  Bump every `@takazudo/*` registry dependency in the current project to its newest version,
  resolving each by the channel it currently tracks. Use when: (1) User says
  '/dev-bump-zudo-deps', 'bump zudo deps', 'bump the @takazudo packages', 'update zfb', 'update
  zudo-doc', or 'update the takazudo toolchain to latest', (2) A new `@takazudo/*` prerelease or
  release has shipped and this project should adopt it, (3) Routine first-party dependency-update
  rounds. Resolution rule: a dep currently on the `next` prerelease line (`0.1.0-next.N`) → newest
  `next` release; a dep on the literal `latest` tag → `dist-tags.latest`; a plain stable semver →
  newest stable. Skips `workspace:`/`file:`/`link:` specs and leaves operator style (exact / `^` /
  `~`) and prerelease channel intact. A bundled script does the discovery + semver resolution;
  this skill drives install + verify + report.

# dev-bump-zudo-deps — Bump all `@takazudo/*` deps to latest

Discover every `@takazudo/*` dependency that resolves to the npm registry across **all**
`package.json` files in the project, bump each to the newest version on the channel it already
tracks, install, and verify the project still builds.

The fragile part — finding the deps, classifying each spec's channel, and computing the target
with correct prerelease semver — is done deterministically by **`scripts/resolve-bumps.mjs`**, so
it never depends on the model recomputing version math by hand.

## Resolution rule (what "bump" means per dep)

The dep's **current spec decides the channel**, and only deps pinned to a concrete version get
rewritten — specs that float are reported but left alone, because rewriting them would silently
turn a deliberate choice into a hard pin:

| Current spec                                   | Resolved to                            | Action     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `0.1.0-next.58` (a `-next.*` prerelease pin)   | newest release on the `next` line      | ✏ `bump`   |
| `^1.2.0-beta.3` (any other prerelease line)    | newest release on that line            | ✏ `bump`   |
| `1.2.3` / `^1.2.3` / `~1.2.3` (stable semver)  | newest stable (`dist-tags.latest`)     | ✏ `bump`   |
| `next` / `latest` / `beta` (a dist-tag string) | reported (what the tag points at now)  | `tag`      |
| `*` / `x` / empty (floating)                   | —                                      | `skip`     |
| `workspace:` / `file:` / `link:` / git / url   | —                                      | `skip`     |

Write-back preserves what was there: an exact pin stays exact, `^`/`~` operators are kept, and a
prerelease-pinned dep stays on its own line. A dep declared via a **dist-tag string** (`next`,
`latest`, …) is intentionally **not** rewritten — it already floats to that tag on install, so the
script just reports what the tag currently resolves to (with a stale-tag/graduation note) and
leaves the pinning decision to you. Non-registry specs (`workspace:*`, `file:`, `link:`,
`portal:`, `catalog:`, `npm:` aliases, git/url) are left untouched — bumping a `workspace:*` dep
would break the monorepo.

### The one gotcha worth knowing: the `next` dist-tag can be stale

For prerelease lines, the npm `next` dist-tag sometimes points at an _older_ version than what's
actually published (or than `latest`). "Newest `next`" means the highest published `-next.*`
version, not whatever the `next` tag literally says. The script already resolves this by scanning
the full version list and flags two cases in its report:

- **stale tag** — `next` dist-tag < newest published `next` version (script uses the newest).
- **graduation** — `latest` is higher than the newest `next` (the line may have moved to stable);
  this is a human call, so surface it instead of silently switching channels.

## Step 1 — Resolve the plan (dry-run)

From the project root (running without `--write` is a dry-run):

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/dev-bump-zudo-deps/scripts/resolve-bumps.mjs"
```

It prints one row per `@takazudo/*` dep — `bump` / `up-to-date` / `tag` / `skip` / `error` — with
current → target and any stale-tag/graduation notes, plus a `Scanned N package.json` line. Pass
exact package names to limit scope (`… resolve-bumps.mjs @takazudo/zfb @takazudo/zfb-runtime`);
`--json` adds a machine-readable plan.

- If every dep is `up-to-date` (or only `tag`/`skip` rows remain), report "already on latest" and stop.
- An `error` row can mean the package is genuinely unpublished **or** a registry/auth/offline
  issue — if every lookup errored the script says so; confirm `npm view @takazudo/<pkg>` works from
  this shell before concluding a package is missing.
- `tag`/`skip` rows are deliberately not rewritten — surface them so the user can pin or update
  those manually if they want.
- The scan does not follow symlinks, so a symlinked nested workspace won't be found; sanity-check
  the `Scanned N` count against the project.

Read the table before writing and **act on any flagged note** — a graduation warning means asking
the user whether to follow the line to stable rather than silently staying on the prerelease channel.

## Step 2 — Apply the bumps

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/dev-bump-zudo-deps/scripts/resolve-bumps.mjs" --write
```

`--write` does a minimal in-place string edit per dep (it preserves each file's formatting). The
same package appearing in several `package.json` files is moved to the **same** target everywhere;
the script warns (`⚠ … multiple targets`) if anything would diverge.

## Step 3 — Check peer coupling

First-party families often pin each other. Before installing, confirm a bumped package's peers are
satisfied by the other targets — bump coupled packages together so the install resolves:

```bash
npm view <bumped-pkg>@<target> peerDependencies
```

If a peer requires a version the plan didn't reach (common with exact-pinned prerelease lines
where `^x-next.40` does NOT satisfy `next.41`), re-run Step 1/2 including that peer so the whole
family lands on a mutually compatible set.

## Step 4 — Install

Use the project's package manager (check `packageManager` in `package.json` / the lockfile —
`pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `package-lock.json` → npm, `yarn.lock` → yarn). Prefer a project-provided
safe-install script if one exists (e.g. `pnpm install:safe`).

```bash
pnpm install        # or: npm install / yarn install
```

**Independent nested workspaces install separately.** After `--write`, the script prints the
distinct directories it edited — install in each one that has its own lockfile (a nested workspace
with an independent lockfile is **not** covered by the root install), and commit every changed
lockfile:

```bash
pnpm install             # root workspace
cd doc && pnpm install   # any printed dir that has its own lockfile
```

## Step 5 — Verify

Run the project's checks and build to prove the bump didn't break anything. Use whatever the
project defines:

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm build      # or: pnpm check, pnpm test, per the project's scripts
```

For a monorepo, build each workspace the bump touched, not just the root. Read the output — a
green typecheck/build is the bar. If a build breaks, the new version likely changed an API or a
peer; report the failure with the offending package rather than forcing the bump through.

## Step 6 — Report

Summarize for the user:

- **Bumped**: `pkg` old → new (note next-channel vs stable)
- **Up-to-date / skipped**: counts (and which were skipped as `workspace:`/non-registry)
- **Flags**: any stale-tag or graduation warnings from Step 1, and the decision taken
- **Verify result**: typecheck/build status per workspace
- **Lockfiles changed**: which ones (so they get committed)

Leave committing to the user / `/commits` unless they asked otherwise.

## Step 7 — File upstream reports for anything the bump surfaced

The bump is the moment first-party problems show up — a stale/misleading dist-tag, a removed or
broken export, a regression in the new version, or a consumer-side fix that should have shipped as
a package change. File these on the **source repo** so they get fixed at the root instead of
worked around forever, via the `/dev-upstream-report` skill:

```
Skill tool: skill="dev-upstream-report"  args="<concise description + evidence>"
```

**Privacy guardrail — this skill runs in arbitrary repos, some of them private client work.** When
writing an upstream report (or any external artifact), describe the problem in terms of the
**public package** (name + version + a minimal repro), and:

- Name the source repo only when it is one of the first-party accounts — `Takazudo/*` or
  `zudolab/*` (e.g. `Takazudo/zudo-front-builder`, `zudolab/zudo-doc`). If the upstream is not one
  of those, do not assume a repo.
- **Never** include the consuming project's name, directory paths, internal URLs, or any
  client/company identifiers. A private client project must not be named or hinted at in a public
  issue. Strip paths down to the package-relevant minimum.
